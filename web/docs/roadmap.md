# Roadmap

## Departure from RxJS

RxJS is powerful, but also headache-inducing complex. I'd like to use simpler primitives to achieve the same results.

## Azure DevOps API design

All providers have been build to mimic the Azure DevOps API.
Which they can because we're basically fetching everything using a ton of api calls building a database on the client.

The other providers would allow optimized API call greatly reducing the amount of calls needed.
